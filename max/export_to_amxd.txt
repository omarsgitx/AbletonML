# Exporting the Max Patch to a Max for Live Device

To use the AbletonML_Bridge with Ableton Live, you need to export the Max patch (.maxpat) as a Max for Live device (.amxd). Follow these steps:

## Method 1: Using Max for Live

1. Open the `AbletonML_Bridge.maxpat` file in Max.
2. Go to File > Export as Max for Live Device...
3. Choose "MIDI Effect" as the device type.
4. Save the file as `AbletonML_Bridge.amxd` in the same directory.

## Method 2: Manual Conversion

1. Open the `AbletonML_Bridge.maxpat` file in Max.
2. Go to File > Save As...
3. Change the file format to "Max for Live Device (*.amxd)".
4. Save the file as `AbletonML_Bridge.amxd` in the same directory.

## Using the Device in Ableton Live

1. Open Ableton Live.
2. Create a new MIDI track.
3. In the browser, navigate to the location where you saved the .amxd file.
4. Drag the `AbletonML_Bridge.amxd` file onto the MIDI track.
5. The device should now be loaded and ready to use.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see errors about missing objects, make sure you have Max for Live installed.
- If the device doesn't receive UDP messages, check that your firewall isn't blocking the connection.
- Make sure the UDP port (7400) is not being used by another application.

## Testing the Connection

1. Start the AbletonML application.
2. Make sure Ableton Live is running with the AbletonML_Bridge device loaded.
3. In the AbletonML application, try a simple command like "set tempo to 120".
4. If the connection is working, you should see the tempo change in Ableton Live.
